# Q2A Email Opt-Out Plugin

This plugin adds a simple "Email Opt-Out" checkbox to each user's **Account Settings** page in Question2Answer. If a user chooses to opt out, **they will no longer receive any system-generated email notifications** from the site (e.g., comment replies, question updates, moderation, etc.).
